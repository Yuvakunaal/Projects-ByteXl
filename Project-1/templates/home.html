    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;
    A car wash service typically involves cleaning and maintaining the exterior and sometimes the interior of a vehicle. It can include washing the exterior to remove dirt, grime, and road debris, as well as cleaning the wheels and tires. Some car wash services also offer interior cleaning, which may involve vacuuming carpets and upholstery, wiping down surfaces, and sometimes conditioning leather seats. The goal is to enhance the appearance of the vehicle and protect its surfaces from damage caused by dirt and contaminants.
